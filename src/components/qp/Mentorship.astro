                Mentors are a fundamental part of QP, providing teams with
                advice and guidance through the ideation and execution of their
                project. Each team is paired with a mentor they can regularly
                consult for advice and insights. Mentors are matched with teams
                based on their expertise and the teamâ€™s project focus, ensuring
                aligned support for each group.
