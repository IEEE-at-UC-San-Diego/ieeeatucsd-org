## 🔄 Migration Process

### Phase 1: Testing
- File metadata extraction validation
- URL classification testing
- Migration preview generation
- File accessibility checks
- Database consistency validation
- Storage structure verification

### Phase 2: Migration
- Batch file processing with progress tracking
- User-based to event-based file movement
- Database reference updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Completion verification

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- Temporary file identification
- Orphaned file removal
- Final validation
- System cleanup

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Temporary Interface
- **Remove After Migration**: This interface should be removed once migration is complete
- **One-time Use**: Designed for the specific user-to-event migration
- **Archive Code**: Move to archive folder after successful migration

### Prerequisites
- **Firebase Backup**: Complete backup of Firebase Storage required
- **Admin Access**: Only administrators can access the interface
- **Stable Connection**: Ensure reliable internet during migration
- **Sufficient Storage**: Verify adequate storage space for temporary files

### Post-Migration Tasks
1. **Remove Migration Interface**: Delete navigation entries and components
2. **Update Documentation**: Mark migration as completed
3. **Test System**: Verify all file operations work correctly
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check file access performance
